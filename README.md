# ðŸ“Š Supermarket Sales Analysis â€” EDA, Data Cleaning & Power BI Dashboard

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This is my **first public data analysis project**, aimed at showcasing my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning using **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**, then designed an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** to extract valuable business insights from the cleaned dataset.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:
- Clean raw sales data for accurate analysis.
- Explore the data to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers.
- Build visual reports to communicate insights effectively.
- Provide business users with a clear view of performance via Power BI.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- **Python:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For EDA & cleaning
- **Power BI:** For dashboard creation & business insights
